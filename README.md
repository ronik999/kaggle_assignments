Kaggle Assignments
==============================

All of the Kaggle assignments are updated in this repository.

STEPS:
==========
-Install all of the requirements for resolving the dependencies issues from the requirements.txt file. 
-All notebooks and data follow the project organization as described below.
-Scores are saved in a csv file inside the model folder according to each week of updated works.
-Models are saved inside the models folder with different numbers of model used for each week.
